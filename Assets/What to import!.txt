IF YOU'RE USING UNITY 5.2 or later:

You will need to use the files in the Vectrosity 5 folder.

If you want to use the DLL, import the Vectrosity5 package.

If you want to use the source code, import the Vectrosity5Source package. This is only recommended if you want to make modifications to the code.

Note that you must only import ONE of the above packages! Also, make sure you only use files in the Vectrosity 5 folder; none of the other files will work with Vectrosity 5.

IF YOU'RE USING UNITY 4.6 - UNITY 5.1:

You should use the files in the Vectrosity 4 folder.

If you want to use the DLL, import the Vectrosity4 package.

If you want to use the source code, import the Vectrosity4Source package. This is only recommended if you want to make modifications to the code.

Note that you must only import ONE of the above packages! Also, make sure you only use files in the Vectrosity 4 folder; none of the other files will work with Vectrosity 4.

IF YOU'RE USING UNITY 4.0 - UNITY 4.2, import the Vectrosity3_Unity4_0 package in the Vectrosity 3 folder.

IF YOU'RE USING UNITY 4.3 - UNITY 4.5, import the Vectrosity3_Unity4_3 package in the Vectrosity 3 folder.

You can also import the Vectrosity3Source package instead of either of the above packages, if you want to use the source code instead of a DLL. This is only recommended if you want to make modifications to the code. The source will work with Unity 4.0 and later.

Note that you must only import ONE of the above packages! Also, make sure you only use files in the Vectrosity 3 folder; none of the other files will work with Vectrosity 3.

Any of the other packages (EditorScripts, Demos, TankZone) require either the DLL or the source to be imported first.
